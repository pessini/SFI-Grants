<img src="https://github.com/pessini/SFI-Grants/blob/main/dgi-logo.png" alt="Ireland's Open Data Portal" width="250"/><br>


For this project I will use two datasets provided by [Ireland's Open Data Portal](https://data.gov.ie/). The concept of Open Data is about making data held by public bodies available and easily accessible online for reuse and redistribution.

### Software version

[R](https://www.r-project.org/foundation/) - version 4.0.2

To run R in [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), check out the [IRKernel](https://irkernel.github.io/) project.

For a list of supported programming languages in Jupyter Notebooks, please refer to the [Jupyter kernels](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels) page in GitHub.

## Datasets

The first dataset is [Science Foundation Ireland Grant Commitments][1] and it details all STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) research and ancillary projects funded by Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) since its foundation in 2000. More information about it can be found [here][3].

The [SFI Gender Dashboard][2] includes SFI research programmes from 2011 that were managed end-to-end in SFIâ€™s Grants and Awards Management System and reflects a binary categorisation of gender, e.g. male or female between 2011 and 2018. More information about it can be found [here][4].
