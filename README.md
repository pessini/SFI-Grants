<img src="https://github.com/pessini/SFI-Grants/blob/main/dgi-logo.png" alt="Ireland's Open Data Portal" width="250"/><br>


For this project I will use two datasets provided by [Ireland's Open Data Portal](https://data.gov.ie/). The concept of Open Data is about making data held by public bodies available and easily accessible online for reuse and redistribution.

## Datasets

The dataset chosen details all STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) research and ancillary projects funded by Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) since its foundation in 2000.
